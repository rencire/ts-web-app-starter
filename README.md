# Typescript Starter Frontend Web Project

A starter frontend web project with focus on developer happiness.

## Notes

* HMR not working
* Consider replacing `lint-staged` with `https://github.com/nrwl/precise-commits` once its more stable.
* Look into `stylelint-webpack-plugin` once stable for webpack 4:
  `https://github.com/JaKXz/stylelint-webpack-plugin/issues/137`
